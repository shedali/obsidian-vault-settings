- @gregtitus: OmniFocus was on the app store on day 1, mostly thanks to the amazing @tjw porting the whole back end, including writing a whole custom replacement to Core Data (which didn't ship on iOS until a year+ later). I did most of the UIKit front end for that first version. https://t.co/GepsmjE07n ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregtitus/status/1585279467101904896))
- @kcase: The OmniFocus 4 TestFlight was approaching its limit of 10,000 testers, so we're removing anyone who TestFlight says hasn't installed a build recently. (We hope its information is reliable!)

- @Dixie3Flatline: Wanting to work long hours to solve a problem you're personally passionate about is fine. Creating a culture where doing that is an expectation regardless of personal drive is a problem, and bragging about overworking yourself *is* one of the things that creates that culture.

We're the AA CDO tranche looking at the BB CDO tranche collapse and going "couldn't happen here" when we have no real understanding of the supply chains ...

- @mikemaccana: Odd coincidence: among many other influences, Cyberpunk 2077 would include Blade Runner.
  Blade Runner was famously botched on release - a moment critical to the ending was cut out. Blade Runner is now considered a classic. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mikemaccana/status/1598040415655321602))
- @realGeorgeHotz: I want to raise awareness of heavenbanning.
  Heavenbanning, similar to shadowbanning, is when a users posts are hidden from all, but also we create bots to engage and agree with the banned user. Bots are only visible to them.
  This practice can reduce toxicity on the Internet. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realGeorgeHotz/status/1599486096500719618))

- @jarredsumner: The "npm:" prefix lets you use multiple versions of a package in the same project. This is a feature supported by npm, yarn, pnpm and now bun install as well.

- @mikemaccana: Nailed it. This is why @markdalgleish is in my high signal/ noise list.
  Platform features Tailwind users are asking for:
  - Frameworks need to handle CSS inside components (Svelte obviously does but people still use React)
  - CSS needs mixins
  - padding-x would be nice https://t.co/4O5UeT8Oyd ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mikemaccana/status/1616371831065219074))

  - YouTube thumbnails
  - Mouse wheel and pinch zoom settings
  - Images from URLs (not in your Vault)
  - Updated Set Grid Script (now remembers the previous grid setting)

- @2DoApp: Interesting. ChatGPT does a fairly decent job at translating #ObjC code ‚û°Ô∏è #Swift ü§Ø Something I wish Xcode did to accelerate adoption. A plug-in waiting to be made then? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/2DoApp/status/1617166005796487171))
- @mikehogan_: We're releasing cozemble differently to the way we released docsndata. 
  We're going to target meaningful increments of value. 
  This first release will have just enough in it to enable simple creation of databases - as long as your data type is string :) https://t.co/A2TmI72heF ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mikehogan_/status/1617150896302968836))

- @mikemaccana: You run bash programs with 'bash'
  You run python programs with 'python'
  You run Ruby programs with 'ruby'
  You run TypeScript programs with tsx, ts-node, or esrun. The one that sucks the least (probably esrun) should just call itself 'typescript'. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mikemaccana/status/1617616516073271296))
- @buildsghost: I wish Remix was more built out as a server framework. Like it‚Äôs great seeing web standards in action but doing the same 20 pieces of boilerplate for every form+action+loader combo is tiresome. I‚Äôve thrown together some utilities but someone should really spend more time on them ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/buildsghost/status/1618132044722368513))

- @swardley: Me : That is extremely dangerous and happens by accident very rarely when I fail to realise I am in a dream.
  X : Why dangerous?
  Me : I can have meetings and conversations with people that never happen. This can be very disorientating for all in the waking world. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1618180965767036930))
- @sollecitom: @johncutlefish Nobody really wants products to change. What people might want is for products to better address a need.
  In many cases the problem is that the changes go in the opposite direction. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sollecitom/status/1618181612545671170))
- @Scobleizer: @ylecun @mustaphadere What does?
  Relevancy.
  Right now ChatGPT is relevant. 
  My dentist talked to me about his explorations yesterday. 
  We weren't talking about Meta or Google. 
  They don't have a competitive system out. 
  You all are losing and losing big. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Scobleizer/status/1618045718094282754))

- @mfts0: @shdli @teaxyz @carnmate Not really. You can use curl with https. 
  Otherwise it‚Äôs the same as for many other tools like homebrew and bun. 
  The cool thing with tea is you can inspect and download the installer script for your platform here: `curl https://t.co/xrWMFfKRoi` or just download it from GitHub ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mfts0/status/1619798582558871553))

  I make great biscuits but not like that.

- @POTUS: In building our EV charging network, we have to ensure that as many chargers work for as many drivers as possible.
  To that end, @elonmusk will open a big part of @Tesla's network up to all drivers.
  That's a big deal, and it'll make a big difference. https://t.co/hb6pyVhtbg ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1625983221279125504))
